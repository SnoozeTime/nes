List of things to do (not in order):
- Fix reading from VRAM (background)
- Read from OAM
- Palette mirroring (Mirrors range and also background mirror)
- Proper PPUCTRL handling
- PPUMASK -> display or mask sprites/background (also 8 columns left)
- 8x16 sprites (need to find a game with that first)
- Scrolling...
- Music...
